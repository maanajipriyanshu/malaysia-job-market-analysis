##  Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Source: [JobStreet All Job Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azraimohamad/jobstreet-all-job-dataset) via Kaggle
- 69,024 job postings from JobStreet Malaysia (2024)
- 11 raw columns including job title, company, location, category, salary, and listing date

### 2. Data Cleaning (Python)
- Standardized `job_type` column - consolidated 11 variations into 4 clean categories
- Extracted numeric salary values from text strings using Regex (e.g. "RM 2,800 - RM 3,200 per month" -> min: 2800, max: 3200, avg: 3000)
- Parsed listing dates and extracted month for time-based analysis
- Removed recruitment agencies from company analysis to show real employer demand
- Handled 37,430 missing salary values (54% of dataset) - identified as a market insight itself

### 3. SQL Analysis
- Loaded cleaned data into SQLite database
- Wrote 3 analytical queries using CTEs and RANK() window functions:
  - Salary and demand ranking by industry
  - Salary ranking by location (min 200 job postings)
  - ICT subcategory salary breakdown

### 4. Dashboard (Power BI)
- 4 KPI cards: Total postings, Avg salary, Unique companies, Industries
- 5 interactive visuals with Industry and Location slicers
- Dark professional theme with average line annotations

##  Why This Project

As a data professional targeting the Malaysian job market, I wanted to go beyond generic salary surveys and analyze real, current hiring data. This project answers questions any job seeker or HR professional in Malaysia would actually care about:

- Which industries pay the most?
- Which cities should I target?
- What ICT role gives the best balance of pay and opportunity?
- How transparent are Malaysian employers about salary?
